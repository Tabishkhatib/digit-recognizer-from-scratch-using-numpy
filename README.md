This project presents a handwritten digit recognition system implemented using a custom-built Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. The objective of the project was to develop a complete learning pipeline from first principles, without relying on high-level deep learning frameworks.
The neural network architecture, forward propagation, loss computation, backpropagation, and parameter updates were implemented manually, demonstrating a clear understanding of the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of supervised learning.
An interactive drawing interface is provided to allow users to draw digits and obtain real-time predictions. The canvas-based user interface code is adapted from an external source, while the machine learning model and inference logic are entirely my own work. The integration between the canvas input and the trained neural network was implemented by me, enabling seamless end-to-end digit recognition.
Key Contributions 
1)Designed and implemented a custom MLP neural network for digit classification
2)Implemented forward pass, loss function, and backpropagation from scratch
3)Trained the model using gradient-based optimization
4)Integrated a canvas-based input interface with the trained model for real-time inference
5)Demonstrated understanding of core machine learning principles beyond framework-level abstraction
